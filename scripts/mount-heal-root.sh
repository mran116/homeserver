# Does exactly two things, both needing root: re-scan the SCSI bus (re-attaches a
# disk whose SATA/SCSI link dropped — the fix for the recurring media-disk drop)
# and `mount -a` (mount whatever fstab says, e.g. /mnt/disk1 + the mergerfs pool).
#
# Deliberately tiny and root-only so a single sudoers rule can grant the
# mount-watchdog exactly this — no broader privilege. The watchdog calls it via
# `sudo -n` when it detects a previously-healthy mount has dropped.
